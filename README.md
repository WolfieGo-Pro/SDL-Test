<h2>Exploring the SDL2 API whilst learning and practicing Image and Video processing.</h2>

<h3>SDL-Test</h3> (A profound name will be given soon).

This project entails understanding and practicing Image processing (starting from pixels, RGB color values, screen class etc.) and using that understanding to Create a Particle animation GUI app.

This version of the program/app in the master branch does particle animation in a complex petal-like shape called a rose curve using polar cordinates.
