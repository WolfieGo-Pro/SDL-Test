<h2>Exploring the SDL2 API whilst learning and practicing Image and Video processing.</h2>

<h3>SDL-Test</h3> (A profound name will be given soon).

This project entails understanding and practicing Image processing (using pixels, RGB color values, screen class etc.) and using that understanding to Create a Particle animation GUI app.

This version of the program/app in the master branch does particle animation in a complex petal-like shape called a rose curve using polar cordinates.

<h4>Note: A SDL2 static and dynamic development library is required when building this project. The dynamic lib (SDL2.dll) is already provided in the master branch. The static lib can be downloaded from the this website https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php </h4>
